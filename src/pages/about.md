## 👩🏻‍🔬 About Me

I am a PhD candidate at **IIT Ropar** working on rare nuclear decays. My research focuses on improving experimental sensitivity through detector development and background suppression to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.

If you're interested in nuclear/particle physics, detector development, or scientific collaborations, feel free to reach out!
